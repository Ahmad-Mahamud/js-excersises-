The  window.lib.getPosts()function is available in the script. It must receive a callback parameter.
After a short delay, the callback will be executed with two parameters:
the first contains an error (if there is one, otherwise null), 
the second an array of articles.
At the click of the button, 
call the getPosts function and
display the items obtained in the console (the getPosts function never returns an error).
