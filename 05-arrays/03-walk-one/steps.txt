    Home work: Analyse UI design of 2 sites

Write 2 pages* about 2 websites and their visual interface. Discuss some aspects on the site that you think have a good and clear User Interface design, and some aspects that can be improved. You can take screenshots but images don’t count for screen space.

Examples:

Colors make it difficult to see certain buttons
It is not clear where to click
Search bar is in the middle of the screen, which makes it really quick to search something
...

Please send them to my mailbox before 9 o’clock Monday. People that are sick on monday have to give it the day they return to class.

If you don’t send anything by the deadline you will not be allowed to join class on Monday.




* No childish requirements of fonts, line height, etc... but if you clearly are cheating, don’t be surprised if you have to do it again.
